  <p>Simple Crispy Chicken Wings Recipe</p>
<h>Ingredients:</h>
1 lb (about 10-12) chicken wings
1-2 tbsp olive oil
Salt and pepper (to taste)
Optional seasonings: garlic powder, paprika, or chili powder
Instructions:
Preheat the Oven: Set your oven to 400°F (200°C).

Prepare the Wings:

Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove moisture (this helps make them crispy).
Place the wings in a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and toss to coat.
Season generously with salt and pepper. If you like, add a sprinkle of garlic powder, paprika, or chili powder for extra flavor.
Arrange on a Baking Sheet:

Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper, and place a wire rack on top.
Arrange the wings in a single layer on the rack. (The rack allows air to circulate around the wings, making them crispier.)
Bake the Wings:

Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for about 40-45 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through, until they’re golden brown and crispy.
Serve and Enjoy:

Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce, like ranch, blue cheese, or BBQ sauce.
Optional Sauce:
For extra flavor, toss the wings in buffalo or BBQ sauce right after baking!

Tips:
For Extra Crispy Wings: Bake at a high temperature, like 425°F (220°C), for 35-40 minutes, but keep an eye on them so they don’t burn.
Air Fryer Option: Cook at 380°F (193°C) for 20-25 minutes, shaking halfway through.
Enjoy your simple and delicious chicken wings!.</p>
