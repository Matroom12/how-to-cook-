  <h1>Simple and Crispy Chicken Wings</h1>
 
<h>Ingredients:</h>
<p>1 lb (about 10-12) chicken wings</p>
<p>1-2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p></p>Salt and pepper (to taste)</p>
<p></p>Optional seasonings: garlic powder, paprika, or chili powder</p>
 <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color:black;">Instructions:</p>
 <p style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; color: red;">Preheat the Oven: Set your oven to 400°F (200°C).</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;">Prepare the Wings:</p>

<p></p>Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove moisture (this helps make them crispy).</p>
<p></p>Place the wings in a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and toss to coat.</p>
<p></p>Season generously with salt and pepper. If you like, add a sprinkle of garlic powder, paprika, or chili powder for extra flavor.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: red;">Pay atention </p>
<p></p>Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper, and place a wire rack on top.</p>
<p></p>Arrange the wings in a single layer on the rack. (The rack allows air to circulate around the wings, making them crispier.)</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: red;">Bake the Wings:</p>

<p></p>Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for about 40-45 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through, until they’re golden brown and crispy.</p>
Serve and Enjoy:

Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce, like ranch, blue cheese, or BBQ sauce.
Optional Sauce:
For extra flavor, toss the wings in buffalo or BBQ sauce right after baking!

Tips:
For Extra Crispy Wings: Bake at a high temperature, like 425°F (220°C), for 35-40 minutes, but keep an eye on them so they don’t burn.
Air Fryer Option: Cook at 380°F (193°C) for 20-25 minutes, shaking halfway through.
Enjoy your simple and delicious chicken wings!.</p>
